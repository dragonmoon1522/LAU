# Universal Accessibility License (LAU)  
**Version 1.1 – July 2025**  
Author: Katherine Vargas – [https://kathware.com.ar](https://kathware.com.ar)

## Introduction

The LAU was created to protect the development of open-source accessible technologies, ensuring the right to free access for users, and guaranteeing that those who create these tools retain recognition, control over commercial use, and fair compensation when their work is used by third parties for economic gain.

This license applies to this software and its derivatives, aiming to prevent any platform or corporation from appropriating tools created for the common good.

It is especially intended for works developed by people with disabilities or by teams actively committed to digital accessibility. It may be used to license accessible software, inclusive technologies, adapted multimedia content (audio, subtitles, TTS, descriptions), accessible pedagogical methodologies, technical documentation, platforms, apps, interfaces, designs, or digital environments aimed at inclusion.

This license does not apply to works unrelated to accessibility, even if they were created by people with disabilities. For example, a song, painting, or fictional book is not covered by the LAU unless it incorporates accessibility criteria or aims to enable others to access previously exclusive content or experiences.

It is compatible with other licenses such as CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, or GPL, as long as they do not conflict with the ethical principles of this license.
